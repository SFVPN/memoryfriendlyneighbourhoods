##Bahamontes##

This theme integrates elements of Google's Material Design with Wordpress using the [Material CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/). The underlying file structure, bower and gulp support is indebted to Jeremy Englert's excellent [JointsWP](http://www.jointswp.com), although Bahamontes itself does not use any Foundation elements.

The theme takes is name from Federico Bahamontes, winner of the 1959 Tour de France and six-time King of the Mountains.

### What comes with Bahamontes?
Bahamontes stands on the features that are found in the Materialize CSS framework, providing an optimised responsive front-end for building mobile-friendly websites. There is support for both standard off-canvas menus and our hybrid, action-button full-page overlay menu. In addition, using the handy customizer, you can add your contact option and update the default logo with a few clicks. What's more, there is:
- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support (thanks again to Jeremy Englert for this)
- Built-in compliance with EU Cookie legislation (the Cookie alert links through to a pre-built privacy page, which you can edit to suit your needs).

### Do I need anything to use Bahamontes?
If you're making any changes to the theme then ideally you'd utilise the built-in gulp support, for which NodeJS is required (see below)

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run npm install
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working
- The 'gulp watch' command will take care of pre-processing and minification if you're making any design changes
